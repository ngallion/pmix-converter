ingredient class with properties{

DB with recipes for items{
    name: {{'ingredient': amount), ('ingredient', amount)},
            {'ingredient': amount), ('ingredient', amount)}},
    name: {{'ingredient': amount), ('ingredient', amount)},
           {'ingredient': amount), ('ingredient', amount)},
           etc.
}

Take in recipe list from DB (table as parameter?){
    convert DB to python library (or is a list better?)
    return list/dict
}

Take in pmix(csv file?){
    pmix_dict = [name: number_sold]

    read in file to pmix_dict

    return pmix_dict
}

Convert from pmix_list to product_list function (pmix_dict, recipes_dict){
    product_dict = [name: amount]


    for item in pmix_dict:
        product_list = call method to convert recipe to product
        (pass in item)<method returns list of products in recipe and amt>

        for product in product_list:
            if product not in product_dict:
                product_dict.add(product:amt)
            else:
                product_dict[product] += product[1]
